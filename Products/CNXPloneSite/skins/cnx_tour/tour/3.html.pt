You can think of the entire base of <em>knowledge as a vast
continuum</em>, a flow of intricately interrelated concepts.  However, 
instructors have traditionally delivered knowledge to students in a 
series of formalized steps that interrupts the flow and breaks the 
natural links among concepts.

Moreover, knowledge is often packaged and
delivered in ways that fail to take into account students&#146; learning
styles and natural curiosity.

<span class="cnx">Connexions</span> offers <em>an alternative to current
modes of teaching and learning</em> as well as to how knowledge is
developed and shared. With powerful software tools, <span
class="cnx">Connexions</span> gives <em>students of any age</em> access
to educational materials that can be readily manipulated to suit
individual learning styles as the student explores the links among
concepts.
